Getting Started With Development
---------------

1. Create your own fork of Astrid by clicking on Github's *Fork* button above (you may have to log in first).

2. Install the following: 
 • *[git](http://git.or.cz/)*
 • *[Eclipse](http://eclipse.org)* (preferred: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers)
 • *[Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)*

3. Use **git** to clone your forked repository (see Github's instructions if you need help). Follow the [Github Line Ending Help](http://help.github.com/dealing-with-lineendings/)

4. Clone the [astridApi](http://github.com/todoroo/astridApi) github project. This is an [Android Library Project](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#libraryProject) and so you will need ADT version 0.9.7+. Put the astridApi folder in the same root level folder as the astrid folder.

4. Open up **eclipse** and import the *astrid*, *astridApi*, and *astrid-tests* projects. There should be no compilation errors. If there are, check the Android page of Eclipse Project Properties to verify the astridApi project was found.

5. Launch the *astrid* project as an **Android Application**, or the *astrid-tests* project as an **Android JUnit Test Suite**.

6. Join the [Astrid Power-Users List](http://groups.google.com/group/astrid-power).

7. Check out the [Product Roadmap](http://wiki.github.com/todoroo/astrid/) and [Issues](http://github.com/todoroo/astrid/issues), and look for something you'd want to tackle.
